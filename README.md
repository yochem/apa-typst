# APA7 template for Typst

This template tries to be as correct as possible in complying to the APA7
formatting guidelines. If something seems incorrect, please let me know.

It however tries to be as unopinionated as possible: it just follows the
guidelines and changes nothing else. It also tries to let you change document
formatting the Typst way. This means no weird or undocumented template
variables.

Currently not ready yet!
